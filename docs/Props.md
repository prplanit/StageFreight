# Props — Composable Presentation Subsystem

Props is StageFreight's typed, discoverable, validated, schema-aware presentation subsystem. Users declare presentation items in config; StageFreight resolves them through typed, validated resolvers to produce normalized structured output.

## Two Badge Systems

StageFreight has two distinct badge mechanisms that serve different purposes:

### Local badge generation (`kind: badge`)

StageFreight's **owned asset pipeline**. Generates SVG badge files locally using the `badge` package with full control over fonts, colors, and rendering. Good for branded, version-stamped, or build-status artifacts where you own the image.

- Powered by `badge` package (local SVG renderer)
- Output: committed `.svg` files referenced via raw URLs
- CLI: `stagefreight badge generate`

### External badge composition (`kind: props`)

StageFreight's **presentation registry**. Typed, validated resolvers that compose URLs from external badge providers (shields.io, codecov, Go Report Card, etc.). Good for ecosystem-standard badges that pull live data from GitHub, Docker Hub, and other services.

- Powered by `props` package (resolver/composer)
- Output: markdown image references to external URLs
- CLI: `stagefreight props list`, `stagefreight props render`

Both compose through narrator — they can coexist in the same README, on the same or separate lines. Use local badges when you control the data and want branded assets. Use props when you want live external data in a standardized format.

## Architecture

Props uses two-level dispatch:

- **Format** — how a prop renders. `badge` is the v1 format. Future formats (`image`, `callout`, `status-chip`) plug in without redesigning the subsystem. Format is intentionally separate from narrator's `kind` field.
- **Type** — which resolver handles the prop. Each type (e.g. `docker-pulls`, `codecov`, `slsa`) maps to a resolver that constructs URLs and metadata.

```
typed spec → registry lookup → resolver → ResolvedProp → FormatMarkdown → narrator composition
```

**Separation of concerns:**
- **Resolver** = what exists (structured data: ImageURL, LinkURL, Alt)
- **FormatMarkdown** = how it looks (single shared renderer for all resolvers)
- **Narrator placement** = where it goes (existing placement system)

### Variant

v1 implements `classic` only — standard markdown badge output. The `Variant` type exists as an implemented seam: unknown variants are rejected at validation time (not silently defaulted). Future render styles (flat, pill, branded-tile) add switch arms without redesigning the render path.

### Validation Model

Config validation (`src/config/validate.go`) checks YAML structure only: `kind: props` must have a `type` field. Semantic validation (param checking, resolution) happens at narrator run time via `ResolveDefinition()`. This is intentional deferred validation — structural errors are caught early, semantic errors surface when resolvers run with real params.

## Configuration

Props items use `kind: props` in narrator config:

```yaml
narrator:
  - file: README.md
    items:
      - id: prop.pulls
        kind: props
        type: docker-pulls
        placement:
          between: ["<!-- sf:badges:start -->", "<!-- sf:badges:end -->"]
          inline: true
        params:
          image: prplanit/stagefreight

      - id: prop.codecov
        kind: props
        type: codecov
        placement:
          between: ["<!-- sf:badges:start -->", "<!-- sf:badges:end -->"]
          inline: true
        params:
          repo: prplanit/stagefreight
          branch: main

      - id: prop.goreport
        kind: props
        type: go-report-card
        params:
          module: github.com/prplanit/stagefreight

      - id: prop.ci
        kind: props
        type: github-actions
        params:
          repo: prplanit/stagefreight
          workflow: build.yml
          branch: main

      - id: prop.slsa
        kind: props
        type: slsa
        params:
          level: "3"
```

### Presentation Overrides

Override fields live outside `params` and apply to any type:

```yaml
      - id: prop.pulls-custom
        kind: props
        type: docker-pulls
        params:
          image: prplanit/stagefreight
        label: "Docker Pulls"     # override auto-derived alt text
        link: "https://hub.docker.com/r/prplanit/stagefreight"  # override auto-derived link
        style: flat-square        # override default badge style
        logo: docker              # override/add shields.io logo
```

| Override | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `label` | Overrides auto-derived alt text |
| `link` | Overrides auto-derived link URL |
| `style` | Appended as `?style=` to shields.io URLs; ignored for native/static providers |
| `logo` | Appended as `&logo=` to shields.io URLs; ignored for native/static providers |

Unsupported presentation overrides are silently ignored (not errors). They are cross-cutting hints, not semantic params. Hard errors are reserved for bad `params` values only.

### Key Rules

- `params` contains only provider-semantic inputs (`repo`, `module`, `image`, etc.)
- `style` and `logo` are **not** params — they flow through presentation overrides only
- Unknown keys in `params` produce a hard error
- Missing required params produce a hard error

## CLI Commands

### `stagefreight props list`

List all available prop types, grouped by category:

```
stagefreight props list
stagefreight props list --category docker
```

### `stagefreight props categories`

List categories with type counts:

```
stagefreight props categories
```

### `stagefreight props show <type>`

Show description, parameters, and example config for a type:

```
stagefreight props show codecov
stagefreight props show docker-pulls
```

### `stagefreight props render`

Resolve a prop and print the resulting markdown:

```
stagefreight props render --type docker-pulls --param image=prplanit/stagefreight
stagefreight props render --type go-report-card --param module=github.com/prplanit/stagefreight
stagefreight props render --type slsa --param level=3
```

## Provider Types

### Shields (`shields`)
Types backed by img.shields.io URLs. Support `style` and `logo` presentation overrides via RenderOptions (not params).

### Native (`native`)
Types using the service's own badge URL (e.g., codecov.io, goreportcard.com, GitHub Actions). Presentation overrides for shields.io (`style`, `logo`) are ignored.

### Static (`static`)
Fixed image URLs with no dynamic provider params (e.g., SLSA level badge, conventional commits).

## Normalization Conventions

| Param | Convention | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `repo` | `owner/name` (no host prefix) | `prplanit/stagefreight` |
| `module` | Full Go module path | `github.com/prplanit/stagefreight` |
| `image` | Docker Hub `org/name` (no registry prefix) | `prplanit/stagefreight` |
| `branch` | Defaults to empty (provider default) | `main` |

### Escaping

Template expansion (`{param}` replacement) inserts values as-is. This is safe for structured values that naturally fit URL paths (`owner/repo`, `github.com/org/name`). For arbitrary text in URL path segments or query values, resolvers apply encoding (`url.PathEscape`, `url.QueryEscape`) themselves. This keeps the common case simple while handling edge cases correctly.

## Resolution Timing

Props resolve at **build/narrator-run time**, not at view time. Resolvers construct URLs and metadata once; the output is static markdown committed to the repo. No network calls needed at resolution time.
